var props = {
    date:
    time:
    val:
}
let {date, time, val} = props

const arr = ['js', 'php', 'c'];
let [x,,z] = arr;


state:

similar to props but it's private and fully contolled by component 
create state only with in class component (before 16.8 version of react )

updation of state is possible but props are not within a component.

we can init props within state

<Student prop1={sad} prop2={asdasd}/>
